	<h3>Don’t Be a Jerk</h3>
	<p>DOT’s Don’t Be A Jerk bike safety campaign humorously highlights the essential dos and don’ts of safe, responsible biking. According to DOT’s 2010 Sustainable Streets Index, commuter cycling increased 262% in New York City from 2000 to 2010. With more bikes on the road, smart cycling is even more crucial to making New York City’s streets safer for everyone using them.</p>

	<h2>Safety Tips!</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Ride in a straight line, <strong>obey traffic signs and signals</strong>, and do not weave in and out of traffic. Riding predictably reduces your chances of a crash with a motor vehicle.</li>
	  <li><strong>Look, signal and look again</strong> before changing lanes or making a turn. Establish eye contact with drivers. Seeing a driver is often not enough. Make sure drivers see you before executing a turn or riding in front of a turning car.</li>
	  <li><strong>Watch out for car doors.</strong> Be prepared for the possibility that a car door may be opened in your path. When possible, leave room between yourself and parked cars (3 feet is generally recommended) so that you can avoid a door that opens unexpectedly.</li>
	  <li><strong>Stay visible.</strong> Wear brightly colored clothing for daytime riding. At night, use reflective materials and lights.</li>
	  <li><strong>Use your bell.</strong> Your bell alerts drivers, pedestrians and other cyclists to your presence, it is required by law.</li>
	  <li><strong>Don't wear earphones.</strong> By law you may wear one earbud, but keeping your ears clear is a much safer choice.</li>
	  <li><strong>Wear a helmet.</strong> Helmets are required by law for children age 13 or younger and working cyclists, helmets are a good idea for cyclists of all ages.</li>
	</ul>
